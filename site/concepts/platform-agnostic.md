# Platform agnostic

Orb is unlike other WebAssembly systems in that itâ€™s not trying to take an existing model like Lambda and make it WebAssembly flavoured. It aims to be broader by being agnostic to a particular target platform.

The strength of WebAssembly is that it can run anywhere:

- Web browsers
- Server (including edge)
- Mobile
- Desktop

So unlike projects like [`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) or [Spin](https://github.com/fermyon/spin) Orb doesn't generate boilerplate JavaScript bindings or plug into a hosted service.

Orb lets you think and write in WebAssembly, working directly with the primitives it has, with a little bit of Elixir sugar syntax.

It uses lightweight conventions that let you integrate into any platform. That way you can write once, and then plugin anywhere.
