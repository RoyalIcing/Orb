# SilverOrb

WebAssembly Core is so bare bones it doesnâ€™t offer even the niceties of C, such as a standard library to allocate memory and convert strings and numbers. People think of C as being low-level but it actually comes with a fair few batteries included.

SilverOrb are these batteries for Orb. It has an arena allocator, dynamic string builder, integer formatter, URL decoder, UTF-8 helpers, and soon parser helpers and an XML builder.
