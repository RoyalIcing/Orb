# SilverOrb

WebAssembly Core is so bare bones it doesnâ€™t offer even the niceties of C, which comes with a standard library to allocate memory and convert strings and numbers. People think of C as being low level but it actually comes with a fair few batteries included.

SilverOrb are these batteries for Orb. It has an arena allocator, dynamic string builder, integer formatter, and memory setting and copying helpers. It will soon have a URL decoder and encoder, parser helpers, XML builder, and UTF-8 functions.

You can [read more about it in its docs](https://hexdocs.pm/silver_orb/SilverOrb.html).
